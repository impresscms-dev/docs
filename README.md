# Welcome to the ImpressCMS documentation

ImpressCMS can be used for many types of web sites. The system is highly scalable and it can be used for example as an intranet for a company with 20,000 employees as well as for building a simple 5-page website for the promotion of your company.

ImpressCMS is extremely useful for managing online communities because it has the ability to create user groups and assign permissions for managing content to each different group.

For each type of website ImpressCMS offers different features with a collection of free modules and themes that are available on the ImpressCMS site: https://www.impresscms.org/modules/downloads/.

A few examples of what you can do with them:

* Publish news of your organization
* Let visitors contact you through a state of the art customizable contact form
* Create and manage articles
* Add a forum to your site
* Sell products through your web site using an online store

...and many more
